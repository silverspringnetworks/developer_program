**Note: The only version of Arduino IDE supported is for Windows 7, 8 and 10**

This reference application consists of two folders:

Folder Name | Content
----------- | -----------
mshield | The Arduino Sketch dependent on the Coap Server library
ssni_coap_server | The SSNI COAP Server Library

## Installation Instructions:

1. Download the folder `mshield` to your local machine and save it at your preferred location e.g.`C:\mshield`

1. Download the folder `ssni_coap_server` to this location:

	`C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Arduino\libraries`

	**Note**: Replace `<user>` with your username

1. Download and install the Arduino IDE 1.8.2 from one of the below locations depending on your Arduino hardware:
	* https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
