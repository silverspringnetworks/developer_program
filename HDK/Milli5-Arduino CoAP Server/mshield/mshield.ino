   \section intro_sec Introduction

   The mshield Arduino application and associated library provides a reference CoAP Server
   for use with the Itron Starfish network and the milli shield hardware.
   Adding the milli shield to the appropriate Arduino board provides the basis for building out
   IoT applications.
   The mshield application was written for the
   Arduino M0 Pro board and the Adafruit Metro M0 Express board.<br>

   The code release consists of the ssni_coap_server library and an Arduino sketch.<br>

   \subsection coap_server The CoAP Server library

   The CoAP Server library is packaged as ssni_coap_server. It contains a basic CoAP server that supports
   the Itron milli chip and Arduino milli shield product and a variety of demonstration sensors.
   
   \subsection The Arduino Sketch

   The Arduino setup() and loop() functions are located in mshield.ino and mshield.h.
   Review the mshield.h as it contains valuable information.<br>

   \section install_sec Installation
   \subsection step1  Step 1:  Download and install Arduino IDE 1.8.7 from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
   \subsection step2  Step 2:  In the preferences, locate the field "Additionial Board Manager URLs". Add this URL to the list: https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json
   \subsection step3  Step 3:  Using the board manager, add the Adafruit SAMD boards. Select the Adafruit Metro M0 Express board.
   \subsection step4  Step 4:  From the mshield distribution (zip file), copy the sub-folder mshield to C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Arduino.
   \note {Replace <user> with your Windows user name.}
   \subsection step5  Step 5:  Copy the folder ssni_coap_server to C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Arduino\libraries.
   \subsection step6  Step 6:  In the folder Arduino\mshield, click on mshield.ino and your Arduino IDE will launch
   \subsection step7  Step 7:  In the IDE, go to the Sketch menu and choose Include Library, and select ssni_coap_server from the Contributed Libraries section
   \subsection step8  Step 8a: In the IDE, go to Sketch/Include Library/Manage Libraries
   \subsection step9  Step 8b:   In the search bar, type RTCZero
   \subsection step10  Step 8c:  Click on "More info"
   \subsection step11  Step 8d:  In the drop-down menu, select v1.5.2 and click Install
   \subsection step12 Step 9a: The following libraries are needed to support the DHT-11 temp sensor (these are needed even if you do not hook a DHT-11 up):
   \subsection step14 Step 9b:   Adafruit Unified Sensor v1.0.2
   \subsection step15 Step 9c:   DHT Sensor Library v1.3.0
   \subsection step16 Step 10:  Build and upload the application to your Adafruit Metreo M0 Express board. Explore and have fun!
